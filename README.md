In this repository , I have submitted few Power BI projects like Amazon Prime,GenZ data ,Finance report of Yahoo.com and many more. 
I have created dashboard by using power query for data cleaning and creating relationships with many tables in order to get data from multiple datasets. 
Here are some dashboard screenshot of my projects :-
